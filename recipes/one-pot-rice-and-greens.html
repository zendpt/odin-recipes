	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>There are some parts of life—brushing teeth, taking a shower, drinking water—that are not showy but wholly essential, often performed without much thought or gratitude. I consider making a weekly pot of rice and greens one of these life skills.</p>
	<p>This habit caught on at the start of the pandemic, when I needed both starchy comfort and an antidote to starchy comfort. Even better that it was a dish I could make with staples I’d purchased the last time I went to the market, however long ago that was.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Rice, or any other grain cooked with water</li>
			<li>Dark leafy greens, like mature spinach or kale</li>
		</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Cook rice as you normally would</li>
			<li>When rice is done cooking and resting, pile the greens on top of the rice and put the lid back on.</li>
			<li>Uncover after five minutes and season greens with salt and then fluff them into the rice.</li>
		</ol>
