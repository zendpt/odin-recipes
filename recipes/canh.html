	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>This time of year, many people cozy up to creamy, rich soups. Not me. I stick with my year-round Vietnamese standby: canh (pronounced “cahhn”). Loaded with vegetables and a little protein, the light, brothy soups signal homey comfort. I learned to make them from my mom, who prepared them five nights a week. When one of us kids jokingly complained, she’d say, “Hot soup warms you in the cold and cools you in the heat.” That always got us to quiet down and slurp up.</p>
	<p>Traditional Viet meals include canh plus a meat dish, a simple vegetable, and rice. In my family, we always started by filling our rice bowls with canh, then returned for seconds or thirds later in the meal to cleanse our palates.</p>
